# Full-Stack Flight: How I Built an Entire Quadcopter Ecosystem from Scratch
- Quadcopters are fascinating technology. And are even more prevalent today due to use in Ukraine vs. Russia.
- Recap Scout + some limitations
- Goals with this one:
- Why I chose Python/Pi Pico (accessibility, understandable)
- You can find basic flight fundamentals in Scout.

**The quadcopter**: an unmanned helicopter with four rotors. A flight system first experimented with in 1907, made massively popular for cinematic and recreational use in the 2010's, and now used as war machines by Russia, Ukraine, and other world powers. 

I've been fascinated with the physical simplicity but applicability of these machines for a number of years now. As a software developer, I viewed architecting and developing my own quadcopter *flight controller*, the onboard "brain" that keeps the quadcopter in the air, as my "mount everest". After much effort, I accomplished this goal in 2023 with my [Scout Flight Controller](https://timhanewich.medium.com/my-greatest-engineering-accomplishment-the-scout-flight-controller-d8937fb45b24).

I was very impressed with myself
