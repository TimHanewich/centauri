    - Recap Scout
    - Problems from last time (i.e. floating point math)
    - Goals with this one (custom comm protocol, full control of overall system, 3D-printed, FPV camera)
    - Why I chose Python/Pi Pico (accessibility, understandable)
    - You can find basic flight fundamental stuff in Scout's series (link)
