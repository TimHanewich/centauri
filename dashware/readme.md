# Dashware Assets
I have used [Dashware](https://dashware.software.informer.com/) for overlaying telemetry data on top of a video file. I include the reusable assets here:
- [Project Template](./project/) - place this in the projects directory (`\Documents\DashWare Projects`) and then rename the folder to whatever you want to call the project. When you open it in Dashware, it will prompt you to find the `data.csv` and `video.MP4` files.
    - This project contains all you need **Centauri data profile**, **Gauges**, etc.
