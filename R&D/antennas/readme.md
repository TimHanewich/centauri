[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ9BEub_OlI) is excellent in showing how to use [the NanoVNA I purchased](https://a.co/d/0T8NOmV)!

## Testing Rubber Ducky Antennas with NanoVNA on Jan 26, 2026
Testing this [433 MHz antenna pair](https://a.co/d/9YqzHMi) I ordered on January 15, 2026.
- Antenna 1
    - [Results](https://imgur.com/a/44KWnlb)
    - Peak resonance: 1.085 SWR @ 441.4 MHz
    - 1.889 SWR @ 433.0 MHz
- Antenna 2
    - [Results](https://imgur.com/a/4tLEowb)
    - Peak resonance: 1.308 SWR @ 369 MHz
    - 6.032 SWR @ 432 MHz (approx 433 MHz)
    - **This one is the problem!**
    - I *believe* this is the one I was using as the transmitter, though I'm not 100% sure (it is best to use the *good* one as the sender, *bad* one as the receiver)
