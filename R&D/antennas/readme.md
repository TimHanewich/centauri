[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ9BEub_OlI) is excellent in showing how to use [the NanoVNA I purchased](https://a.co/d/0T8NOmV)!

## Testing Rubber Ducky Antennas with NanoVNA on Jan 26, 2026
Testing this [433 MHz antenna pair](https://a.co/d/9YqzHMi) I ordered on January 15, 2026.
- Antenna 1
    - [Results](https://imgur.com/a/44KWnlb)
    - Peak resonance: 1.085 SWR @ 441.4 MHz
    - 1.889 SWR @ 433.0 MHz
- Antenna 2
    - [Results](https://imgur.com/a/4tLEowb)
    - Peak resonance: 1.308 SWR @ 369 MHz
    - 6.032 SWR @ 432 MHz (approx 433 MHz)
    - **This one is the problem!**
    - I *believe* this is the one I was using as the transmitter, though I'm not 100% sure (it is best to use the *good* one as the sender, *bad* one as the receiver)

## Testing New Rubber Ducky Antennas on Jan 28, 2026
- I purchased two more [433 MHz rubber ducky antennas](https://a.co/d/9YqzHMi). Both performed *terribly* out of the box:
    - Antenna 3: 
        - Peak resonance: 1.312 SWR @ 386 MHz
        - 6.168 SWR @ 433 MHz
    - Antenna 4:
        - Peak resonance: 1.038 SWR @ 368 MHz
        - 5.4 SWR @ 433 MHz
- The [POBADY 433 MHz Atnenna](https://a.co/d/bQEKdQH)
    - 1.144 SWR @ 433 MHz (*this is great!*)
    - And low SWR across a wide spectrum (it is a broad band antenna)

## Testing New Antennas on Jan 30, 2026
I purchased a two pack of [these antennas](https://a.co/d/i0L4Aux) on January 28, 2026, received January 30, 2026.
- Antenna 1 [results](https://imgur.com/a/XjEMMzh):
    - Peak resonance @ 455 MHz = 1.03 SWR
    - 433 MHZ = 2.810 SWR
- Antenna 2 [results](https://imgur.com/a/BQm7FPD):
    - Peak resonance @ 445 MHZ = 1.007 SWR
    - 433 MHz = 1.864 SWR
