# Repairing FPV Antenna on December 28, 2025
The antenna of the [AKK BA3](https://a.co/d/6bDJUDt) I purchased previously broke off when a heavy laptop fell on top of the quad!

I had been flying *without* an antenna with some success. The range seemed to be limited and more static than usual, but not severely... but I never got to really test it *with* the antenna on much anyway as I never got to fly it anywhere other than my front yard with the antenna still on!

I took a q-tip with rubbing alcohol to where the antenna and solder pad was broken and then chipped away the remaining glue or material until I had something there. I soldered back onto it a **12.9 mm** wire that sticks straight up. This will serve as the new antenna. 

In my tests at home, it seemed to work well. From my master bedroom, it worked well with less static than I remember when it did *not* have an antenna. So maybe it will work... we'll see!
