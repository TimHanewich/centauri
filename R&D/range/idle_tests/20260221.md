# Idle Tests on Feb 21, 2026
- Test 1
    - Antenna unpluged
    - Motors not running. At 0% in normal operation mode (so PWM still active!)
    - Holding next to empty antenna SMA port, only mild noise. Still clearly seeing occasional telemetry packet come out.
    - Noise seems very mild. Good!!!!
- Test 2
    - Still no antenna
    - Holding SWR antenna right next to SMA port (touching it)
    - Alternates between 0% and 30% throttle. Same noise between both.
- Test 3
    - 433 MHz antenna screwed in
    - Held SWR antenna right up to the SMA port *and* across the height of the antenna (touching the antenna)
    - oddly, a significant amount of noise at first... but it seemed to go away. Later in the recording where you see little to no noise, that *was* still me holding it close to the antenna and SMA port. Why it improved? I don't know.
        - *I then did another test while not recording. Again, showed some mild noise at first but then mostly faded away... perhaps it is the receiver getting "used to" (insensitive to)the noise*
