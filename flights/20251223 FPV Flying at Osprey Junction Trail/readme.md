## Battery Info
I ran the first battery down to about 15.0 volts. I ran the second battery down to 16.4 volts before crashing it. This is the first time I noticed significantly lower battery consumption with smooth, low-performance flight characteristics. I believe it was the final flight on the first battery in which I noticed this.
