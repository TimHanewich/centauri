# Flying at Nokokmis Community Park on January 31, 2026

## Changes in this flight from last time:
- SWR-tested antennas (threw out a total dud I was previously using)
- Drone now has "Last Received" recording to telemetry
- Going to fly higher to avoid fresnel zone obstruction

## Antennas Used
Antennas used (see [antenna R&D page](../../R&D/antennas/) for more info:
- "Antenna 1" from [this two pack](https://a.co/d/9YqzHMi), ordered Jan 15, 2026.
    - 1.889 SWR @ 433.0 MHz
    - Using this as Tx (by PC transmitter)
    - ~9.4% loss due to SWR
- "Antenna 2" from [this two pack](https://a.co/d/i0L4Aux), ordered Jan 28, 2026.
    - 1.864 SWR @ 433 MHz
    - Using this as Rx (on drone) becuase it is small and compact
    - ~9.1% loss due to SWR

Combined system loss with both these antennas is 17.7% (it is **82.3%** efficient) - estimated 0.84 dB loss. Estimated 9% reduction in total range due to SWR inefficiency.
