# Flying at Nokomis Community Park on January 20, 2026
This was my first time flying with the externally mounted 433 MHz antenna for the HC-12s (both on the drone and the transceiver platform).

I didn't get more than 5 minutes of flying in. The FPV AIO module (the first one I got, which has the antenna broken off) could not transmit more than ~30 feet away. This small range made it impossible to fly via the FPV monitor. I did a small amount right in front of me via eye, but overall aborted the flight. Next goal = design an encasing I can put a new AIO module in that will *protect* the antenna in the case of flipping over.
