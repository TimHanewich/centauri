# December 20, 2025: FPV Flying at Nokomis Community Park
A total of **ten** flights were flown during this outing at [Nokomis Community Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tGyyJBgSFAaLaP1k6), as described below:

In the graphic above, the start and end time, in seconds, of each flight are noted as a timestamp on the [raw, concatenated onboard video](https://youtu.be/TvlmgyIwnbQ) and the [raw, concatenated GoPro ground video](https://youtu.be/mi2_N91XVpg) (well, only flight 2 has the GoPro video times).

A total flight time of 1,606 seconds (26 minutes and 46 seconds) across two batteries achieved:
- 13 minutes and 37 seconds on battery 1 (817 seconds)
- 13 minutes and 9 seconds on battery 2 (789 seconds)

## Videos

## Files
- [The original onboard telemetry log file (binary)](https://github.com/TimHanewich/centauri/releases/download/16/log) - *note, many flights before were also recorded on this log, not all pertain to this flying day*
- [That log file, unpacked as a CSV file via the analysis program](https://github.com/TimHanewich/centauri/releases/download/16/log.csv)
- [The log file as a .xlsx file, where I marked each flight start/stop time](https://github.com/TimHanewich/centauri/releases/download/16/log.xlsx)

## Ending Battery Voltages
Both 4S LiPo batteries were fully charged (16.8v) when I began flying. They ended at the following voltages:
- Battery 1 = 14.1v, but I believe it said 13.1v on the screen just when finishing flying. Even full throttle (60% governed) was not enough to ascend at this point.
- Battery 2 = 14.3v, which is probably about what i saw, but I may have seen 14.1v on the screen.

## Other Notes
- The antenna of the FPV camera was alreay damaged but super glued on. It fell back off after the first crash (tumbled on its head) after I lost command signal (but not FPV signal). The perfromance of the FPV range seeemd acceptable but maybe a bit worse after that.
- Regarding the onboard log, many flying tests were also done on the log... so the actual flying portion is probably only the last few logs!
