# Flying at Nokokmis Community Park on February 7, 2026

## Changes in this flight from last time:
- New Antennas from Digikey
    - Tx Antenna ~1.5 SWR
    - Rx Antenna ~1.1 SWR
- Drone now has "Last Received" recording to telemetry
- Going to fly higher to avoid fresnel zone obstruction

## The Good
- The new antenna system I have works quite well!
- New frame for AIO module successfully protected the antenna from breaking off in worst case scenario impact!
- The new antenna I got, mounted on the drone, did not break at all. Durable in the position I have it in.

## The Bad
I think the position of the antenna on the drone (behind the battery) has something to do with why it crashed... battery got in between transmitter and antenna.
