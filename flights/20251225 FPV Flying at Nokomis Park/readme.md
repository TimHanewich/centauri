## Videos
- View from my wife filming on iPhone (raw, concatenated): https://youtu.be/oEOU1fnXip0
- Onboard footage (raw, concatenated): https://youtu.be/5-4iaf9ASgM
- [Flight 2 with both perspectives and telemetry overlay](https://youtu.be/51nHzUkuma8)
    - [The same video, but with the angle telemetry as well](https://youtu.be/Pn5RMQgWMv8) (angle data not fully reliable with simple complementary filter used at this point)

## Files
- [Raw telemetry log](https://github.com/TimHanewich/centauri/releases/download/18/log)
- [Telemetry log, unpacked as .csv file](https://github.com/TimHanewich/centauri/releases/download/18/log.csv)
- [Telemetry log as .xlsx, with notes on flights](https://github.com/TimHanewich/centauri/releases/download/18/log.xlsx)
    - Note: Flight #4 telemetry cuts off early, I believe because the telemetry collected filled the buffer!

## Battery Depletion
- Battery 1 was flown down to ~15.0 volts. Consumed ~2,649 mAh (what it charged to later).
- Battery 2 was flown down to ~15.44 volts. Consumed ~1,410 mAh (what it charged to later).
