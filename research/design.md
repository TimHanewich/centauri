    - 5v buck converter (if speed controllers do not have BEC)
    - "High Level" MCU: Rasperry Pi Pico
        - Read input from HC-12 (control commands from remote control)
        - Pass fight control inputs on to LL MCU via UART
        - Read incoming status packet from LL MCU
        - Read from TF-Luna and append to status packet
        - Read from BMP180 pressure sensor and append to status packet
        - Read from QMC5883L magnetometer and append to status packet
        - Read battery level (voltage divider) and append to status packet
        - Send status packet back to remote controller via HC-12
    - "Low Level" MCU: Rasperry Pi Pico
        - Read input from HL MCU via UART
        - Read gyro + accel from IMU
        - Pass through PID loop to determine M1-4 throttles
        - Use complementary fiter to estimate roll & pitch angles
        - Set M1-4 throttles
