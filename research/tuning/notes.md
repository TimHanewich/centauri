## Testing Notes on Oct 24, 2025
- Pitch PID doesnt seem right - is it reversed? Doesnt seem to be resisting. Is it inverted? May be doing the opposite
- Roll feels quite good. Got this far with P and I, didn't get to D yet:
    - Idle throttle = 8%
    - Max throttle = 25%
    - Roll kP: 15,000
    - Roll kI: 3,500
    - Roll kD: 0
    - All else set to 0 (isolte testing of roll axis)
    - I limit = 25,0000. May be safe to bring this higher, I feel it spoolign safely and slowly.

## PID Tuning on Oct 25, 2025
- Tuning process for both pitch and roll axes together:
    - Increase P until fast oscilations.
        - Got up to 25,000 kP
        - Going down to 80% of that, **20,000**
    - Increase I until slow wobble
        - Wobbles clearly @ 1,000. Severely @ 2,000
        - 500 seems to be tolerable. But maybe 750 is right.
    - Increase D
        - Maybe 500-1000 feels ok
- What seems best at the end:
    - Pitch kP: 20,000
    - Pitch kI: 500
    - Pitch kD: 500
    - Roll kP: 20,000
    - Roll kI: 1,000
    - Roll kD: 500
- D seemed to help a bit with stability but I couldn't really feel it that much. Maybe could go higher.
- Beginning to see the pitch axis behaves differently than the roll axis.
- Pitch axis has long oscilations caused by I term. Probably because of weight along pitch axis.
- So maybe I have to tune the pitch and roll axis separately?
- I tried using Scout's PID proportions too - still slow wobble. Seems I is too severe.

## PID Investigating on Oct 26, 2025
- It is evident the I term clamp is way way way too low: https://i.imgur.com/1gZ4dpC.png
- As seen in that test, the I term is being clamped right away.
- And worse, the I term clamp is only 2 bytes, so the max I can send is 65,535. **That is not nearly enough, compared to the P term getting into the several hundred thousands!**
- So what to do?
    - Multiply the I term limit times something like 10. Just to lift it up. So it will still be sent as 2 bytes (0-65,535), but then will be multiplied by 10 or something bit to make it much larger. (higher headroom for the I limit)
    - For testing purposes, remove I term limit? Not good for real world but could be helpful for testing.
- PID Tuning *after* removing the I Limit clamp:
    - I term feels much better now! It doesn't have the long oscilations like I was seeing before. Feels much more like Scout did.
    - Optimal values I find for **Pitch + Roll** axes:
        - kP: 20,000
        - kI: 700
        - kD: 500
    - Those above were found only through some testing. I'm sure can optimize from there. But I think these are enough for a first flight.
- PID tuning yaw (again, still no I limit). 
    - Optimal values seem:
        - kP: 45,000
        - kI: 750
        - kD: 0
    - kP seemed a bit better at 50,000. But backed down to be safe.
    - kI seems very unsafe. 750 may be a bit high. Will have to see how it flies. May want to try like 400-500 if too much.

## Tethered Test Flight on October 26, 2025
- First started with:
    - Pitch kP: 20,000
    - Pitch kI: 700
    - Pitch kD: 500
    - Roll kP: 20,000
    - Roll kI: 700
    - Roll kD: 500
    - Yaw kP: 45,000
    - Yaw kI: 750
    - Yaw kD: 0
- Definitely WAY too much fast oscilation. Not flyable at all. Quite dangerous.
- I tried the Scout proportions. Goes NUTS right away. I even tried 5% of them. Still goes nuts. Doesn't seem right.
- What I landed with, at the end. Seeemed best but still oscilation issues (did not get to D term of I on the yaw yet):
    - Pitch kP: 10,000
    - Pitch kI: 300
    - Pitch kD: 0
    - Roll kP: 6,000
    - Roll kI: 200
    - Roll kD: 0
    - Yaw kP: 35,000
    - Yaw kI: 0
    - Yaw kD: 0
- With the above, it somewhat picks up and flies but then quickly goes crazy (oscilations)
