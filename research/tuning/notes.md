## Testing Notes on Oct 24, 2025
- Pitch PID doesnt seem right - is it reversed? Doesnt seem to be resisting. Is it inverted? May be doing the opposite
- Roll feels quite good. Got this far with P and I, didn't get to D yet:
    - Idle throttle = 8%
    - Max throttle = 25%
    - Roll kP: 15,000
    - Roll kI: 3,500
    - Roll kD: 0
    - All else set to 0 (isolte testing of roll axis)
    - I limit = 25,0000. May be safe to bring this higher, I feel it spoolign safely and slowly.

## PID Tuning on Oct 25, 2025
- Tuning process for both pitch and roll axes together:
    - Increase P until fast oscilations.
        - Got up to 25,000 kP
        - Going down to 80% of that, **20,000**
    - Increase I until slow wobble
        - Wobbles clearly @ 1,000. Severely @ 2,000
        - 500 seems to be tolerable. But maybe 750 is right.
    - Increase D
        - Maybe 500-1000 feels ok
- What seems best at the end:
    - Pitch kP: 20,000
    - Pitch kI: 500
    - Pitch kD: 500
    - Roll kP: 20,000
    - Roll kI: 1,000
    - Roll kD: 500
- D seemed to help a bit with stability but I couldn't really feel it that much. Maybe could go higher.
- Beginning to see the pitch axis behaves differently than the roll axis.
- Pitch axis has long oscilations caused by I term. Probably because of weight along pitch axis.
- So maybe I have to tune the pitch and roll axis separately?
- I tried using Scout's PID proportions too - still slow wobble. Seems I is too severe.

## PID Investigating on Oct 26, 2025
- It is evident the I term clamp is way way way too low: https://i.imgur.com/1gZ4dpC.png
- As seen in that test, the I term is being clamped right away.
- And worse, the I term clamp is only 2 bytes, so the max I can send is 65,535. **That is not nearly enough, compared to the P term getting into the several hundred thousands!**
- So what to do?
    - Multiply the I term limit times something like 10. Just to lift it up. So it will still be sent as 2 bytes (0-65,535), but then will be multiplied by 10 or something bit to make it much larger. (higher headroom for the I limit)
    - For testing purposes, remove I term limit? Not good for real world but could be helpful for testing.
- PID Tuning *after* removing the I Limit clamp:
    - I term feels much better now! It doesn't have the long oscilations like I was seeing before. Feels much more like Scout did.
    - Optimal values I find for **Pitch + Roll** axes:
        - kP: 20,000
        - kI: 700
        - kD: 500
    - Those above were found only through some testing. I'm sure can optimize from there. But I think these are enough for a first flight.
- PID tuning yaw (again, still no I limit). 
    - Optimal values seem:
        - kP: 45,000
        - kI: 750
        - kD: 0
    - kP seemed a bit better at 50,000. But backed down to be safe.
    - kI seems very unsafe. 750 may be a bit high. Will have to see how it flies. May want to try like 400-500 if too much.

## Tethered Test Flight on October 26, 2025
- First started with:
    - Pitch kP: 20,000
    - Pitch kI: 700
    - Pitch kD: 500
    - Roll kP: 20,000
    - Roll kI: 700
    - Roll kD: 500
    - Yaw kP: 45,000
    - Yaw kI: 750
    - Yaw kD: 0
- Definitely WAY too much fast oscilation. Not flyable at all. Quite dangerous.
- I tried the Scout proportions. Goes NUTS right away. I even tried 5% of them. Still goes nuts. Doesn't seem right.
- What I landed with, at the end. Seeemed best but still oscilation issues (did not get to D term of I on the yaw yet):
    - Pitch kP: 10,000
    - Pitch kI: 300
    - Pitch kD: 0
    - Roll kP: 6,000
    - Roll kI: 200
    - Roll kD: 0
    - Yaw kP: 35,000
    - Yaw kI: 0
    - Yaw kD: 0
- With the above, it somewhat picks up and flies but then quickly goes crazy (oscilations)

## Success on October 26, 2025!!!!
- **Optimal PID values** (these work!)
    - Throttle values
        - Idle: 20% (0.2) *While 8% is minimum for motor sping, I increased this because the 0.08 was just too weak. When I let off the drone sunk.*
        - Max: 60% (0.6)
    - PID Values
        - Pitch kP: 4,371
        - Pitch kI: 102
        - Pitch kD: 64,286
        - Roll kP: 4,371
        - Roll kI: 102
        - Roll kD: 64,286
        - Yaw kP: 17,143
        - Yaw kI: 137
        - Yaw kD: 0
- How did I arrive at these values?
    - I noticed the Scout flight controller PID calculations considered the cycle time: https://i.imgur.com/JuwblGp.png
    - However, the `cycle_time_seconds` was always 0.004 (it is 1/250 hz).
    - SOOOO, really the I term and D term were massively lowered/raised based on that being thrown in
    - So while I was using Scout's raw PID values, using those as a direct proportion to Centauri was not correct because Centauri does **NOT** have the time built in the same way.
    - So, to adjust, I divided the **I Term** by 250 (same as multiplying by 0.004) and then multiplied the **D Term** by 250 (same as dividing by 0.004).
    - Then, I applied those NEW ratios to a Centauri scale (0-65,535): https://i.imgur.com/ivi8bPp.png
