## Future Improvements to Make
- Physical design
    - Clean up wires
    - Female plug for battery needs to be pulled in closer
    - Fix orientation of holes on arm so wires face ESC directly
    - "Slot" (holder) for ESCs on each arm
    - A better way to secure the battery
    - Option to use LiIon batteries instead (18650 or 21700)
- Software
    - Detailed telemetry recording to local storage
    - Minimize ongoing telemetry screening?
