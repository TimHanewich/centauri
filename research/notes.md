## Testing Notes on Oct 24, 2025
- Pitch PID doesnt seem right - is it reversed? Doesnt seem to be resisting. Is it inverted? May be doing the opposite
- Roll feels quite good. Got this far with P and I, didn't get to D yet:
    - Idle throttle = 8%
    - Max throttle = 25%
    - Roll kP: 15,000
    - Roll kI: 3,500
    - Roll kD: 0
    - All else set to 0 (isolte testing of roll axis)
    - I limit = 25,0000. May be safe to bring this higher, I feel it spoolign safely and slowly.

## Tuning on Oct 25, 2025
- Tuning process for both pitch and roll axes together:
    - Increase P until fast oscilations.
        - Got up to 25,000 kP
        - Going down to 80% of that, **20,000**
    - Increase I until slow wobble
        - Wobbles clearly @ 1,000. Severely @ 2,000
        - 500 seems to be tolerable. But maybe 750 is right.
    - Increase D
        - Maybe 500-1000 feels ok
- What seems best at the end:
    - Pitch kP: 20,000
    - Pitch kI: 500
    - Pitch kD: 500
    - Roll kP: 20,000
    - Roll kI: 1,000
    - Roll kD: 500
- D seemed to help a bit with stability but I couldn't really feel it that much. Maybe could go higher.
- Beginning to see the pitch axis behaves differently than the roll axis.
- Pitch axis has long oscilations caused by I term. Probably because of weight along pitch axis.
- So maybe I have to tune the pitch and roll axis separately?
