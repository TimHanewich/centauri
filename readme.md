# Centauri: Multi-MCU Quadcopter Flight Controller
The successor to my [Scout flight controller](https://github.com/TimHanewich/scout).

## High-Level System Design
- Radio Controller (single MCU)
    - Rasberry Pi Pico
    - SSD-1306 OLED
    - HC-12
    - Throttle potentiometer = [sliding potentiometer](https://a.co/d/7xYnKI3)
    - Trigger- potentiometer (for yaw)
    - Trigger+ potentiometer (for yaw)
    - [Joystick for pitch + roll](https://a.co/d/1TQdeZK)
    - 18650 cell
    - MT3608 voltage booster
    - TP4056 cell charger
- Quadcopter
    - HC-12 radio communication module
    - MPU-6050 IMU *(connected to LL MCU)*
    - TF-Luna lidar *(connected to HL MCU)*
    - BMP180 pressure sensor *(connected to HL MCU)*
    - QMC5883l magnetometer *(connected to HL MCU)*
    - 4 motors w/ propellers
    - 4 speed controllers (1 per motor)
    - 2-4S LiPo battery
    - Voltage divider for battery
    - 5v buck converter (if speed controllers do not have BEC)
    - "High Level" MCU: Rasperry Pi Pico
        - Read input from HC-12 (control commands from remote control)
        - Pass fight control inputs on to LL MCU via UART
        - Read incoming status packet from LL MCU
        - Read from TF-Luna and append to status packet
        - Read from BMP180 pressure sensor and append to status packet
        - Read from QMC5883L magnetometer and append to status packet
        - Read battery level (voltage divider) and append to status packet
        - Send status packet back to remote controller via HC-12
    - "Low Level" MCU: Rasperry Pi Pico
        - Read input from HL MCU via UART
        - Read gyro + accel from IMU
        - Pass through PID loop to determine M1-4 throttles
        - Use complementary fiter to estimate roll & pitch angles
        - Set M1-4 throttles
