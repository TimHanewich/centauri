# Pilot's Controllers
A pilot will need a way of controlling the Centauri quadcopter as it flies! This repo provides two controllers:
- Option 1 (Recommended) = a script that can be installed on a PC with an Xbox Controller attached and a custom transceiver platform.
- Option 2 (a bit more complex) = a mobile-based system (3D-printed)

## Custom-Build Controller?
- Throttle switch could be a [drill trigger switch](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=drill+trigger+switch&crid=1FIV5ICPXFOEH&sprefix=drill+trigger+switch%2Caps%2C137)?
    - [Example 1](https://a.co/d/4bwHzMZ)
    - [Example 2](https://a.co/d/g6Vb8m6)
    - [Maybe this?](https://a.co/d/027QLs5) - but is it variable speed? Or only on/off?
