## 3D-Printed Mount
I found [this AKK BA3 AI0 mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4207871) file on Thingiverse. I remixed this design into a complete base with a 3-prong mount that can be mounted to the front of Centauri, similarly to how a GoPro would: [AKK BA3 Mount with 3-Prong Base on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7229291).

At 30% infill, it take approx. 1.5 hours to print (that is being relatively slow).

I designed it in Blender; you can find all iterative design files [here](https://github.com/TimHanewich/centauri/releases/download/15/FPV.Mount.zip) in case you wanted to modify it by visiting an earlier version of it.
