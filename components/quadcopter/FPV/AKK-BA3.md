## 3D-Printed Mount
I found [this AKK BA3 AI0 mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4207871) file on Thingiverse. I remixed this design into a complete base with a 3-prong mount that can be mounted to the front of Centauri, similarly to how a GoPro would: [AKK BA3 Mount with 3-Prong Base on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7229291).

Version 1 (low profile, but susceptible to the antenna mount portion being damaged due to a roll):

Version 2 (lifted sides to take the brunt of impact in the event of roll, protecting antenna mount of AIO module):

I designed it in Blender; you can find all iterative design files below:
