# FPV Monitor: SoloGood
I purchased [the SoloGood FPV Monitor](https://a.co/d/dc8PKzo) to watch the video:
- 4.3 inch screen size (16x9) - 800x480
- 5.8 Ghz
- 40 channels
- Supports recording on a micro SD card (**32 GB max size!**)
- I think this is a generic unit dropship businesses rebrand (found it under "FYS" brand as well)
